# Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. 
# Benefits of inheritance are: 
# (1)It represents real-world relationships well.
# (2)It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows 
# us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
# (3)It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses 
# of B would automatically inherit from class A.

# Creating a Parent Class

# A Python program to demonstrate inheritance

class Person(object):

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

    # To check if this person is an employee
    def Display(self):
        print(self.name, self.id)


# Driver code
emp = Person("Satyam", 102) # An Object of Person
emp.Display()

# Creating a Child Class

class Emp(Person):

    def Print(self):
        print("Emp class called")
	
Emp_details = Emp("Mayank", 103)

# calling parent class function
Emp_details.Display()

# Calling child class function
Emp_details.Print()
