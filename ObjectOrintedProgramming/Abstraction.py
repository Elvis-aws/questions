# Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact 
# with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that "what 
# function does" but they don't know "how it does."


# Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
# Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).

# The abstract keyword is used for classes and methods:

# Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

# Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).
